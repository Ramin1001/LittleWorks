                    <p>Every design project is different and the best will result from trust between the client and the designer. The most effective way to assure trust meets both client and designer expectations in an engagement is to codify the relationship with a written agreement. The standart agreement is adaptable to unique circumstances while still drawing from the best proven practices based on mutual respect and clarity. It is a modular approach that recognizes the different needs and requirements of different types of engagements.</p>
